## Series of posts about building Redux-like Single Source of Truth in SwiftUI.
Single source of truth eliminates tons of bugs produced by creating multiple states across the app. The main idea here is describing the whole app state by using a single struct or composition of structs. A single state for the whole app makes it easier to debug and inspect.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Combine

protocol Effect {
    associatedtype Action
    func mapToAction() -> AnyPublisher<Action, Never>
}

struct Reducer<State, Action> {
    let reduce: (inout State, Action) -> Void
}

final class Store<State, Action>: ObservableObject {
    @Published private(set) var state: State

    private let reducer: Reducer<State, Action>
    private var cancellables: Set<AnyCancellable> = []

    init(initialState: State, reducer: Reducer<State, Action>) {
        self.state = initialState
        self.reducer = reducer
    }

    func send(_ action: Action) {
        reducer.reduce(&state, action)
    }

    func send<E: Effect>(_ effect: E) where E.Action == Action {
        effect
            .mapToAction()
            .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
            .sink(receiveValue: send)
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }
}

```
